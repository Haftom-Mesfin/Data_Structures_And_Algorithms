    * Divide and conquer algorithm
    * Recursive algorithm
    * In place algorithm which means unlike the merge sort we don't need to create a new array to sort
    * which in turn means we don't need to use extra memory for sorting (this advantage over merge sort)
    * average case = O(nlogn), worst case = O(n2)
    *
    * Uses a pivotal element to partition the array into two parts
    * Elements < pivotal to its left
    * Elements > pivotal to its right
    * pivotal will then be in its correct sorted position
    *
    * Process is now repeated for the left and right arrays
    * Eventually every element has been the pivot. So every element will be in its corresponding position
